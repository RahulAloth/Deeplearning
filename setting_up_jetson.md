reComputer industrial series offers full systems including NVIDIA Jetson™ Xavier NX/ Orin Nano/Orin NX/ modules, ranging from 20 TOPS to 100 TOPS AI performance. Preinstalled with Jetpack 5.1.1, reComputer industrial simplifies development, ideal for bulding applications of video analytics, object detection, natural language processing, medical imaging, and robots, which brings digital transformantion across industries of smart cities, security, industrial automation, smart factories.

reComputer industrial comes with a passive heatsink and a fanless design, making it ideal for use in demanding environments. The passive heatsink allows for efficient cooling without the need for a fan, reducing the risk of component failure due to dust or other contaminants. The fanless design also reduces noise levels and power consumption, making it suitable for use in noise-sensitive environments and minimizing energy costs.

reComputer industrial has 2 RJ45 GbE ports, one of which is a PoE PSE port for providing power over Ethernet to devices like IP cameras. This eliminates the need for a separate power source and makes it easier to deploy network devices in areas without readily available power outlets. The other GbE port is used to connect to a network switch or router, enabling communication with other devices on the network and access to the Internet.
