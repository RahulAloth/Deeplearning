# reComputer Industrial Series — Key Technical Highlights
Hihligted varient of Nvidia Jetson Platform which is used for the Deeplearning experiment is J4011. 
See some important features of it below:

## 🚀 Edge AI Performance
- Built around NVIDIA Jetson modules such as Xavier NX, Orin Nano, and Orin NX.  
- AI compute ranges roughly from **20 TOPS up to 100 TOPS**, enabling demanding edge‑AI workloads.  
- Ships with **JetPack 5.1.1**, providing CUDA, TensorRT, and the full NVIDIA software stack out of the box.  
- Suitable for applications like:
  - Video analytics  
  - Object detection and tracking  
  - Natural language processing  
  - Medical imaging  
  - Robotics and autonomous systems  
- Designed to support digital transformation across sectors including smart cities, industrial automation, security, and smart factories.

## 🌡️ Rugged Thermal Design
- Features a **passive heatsink** with a **fanless enclosure**.  
- Benefits of this design:
  - Reliable cooling without moving parts  
  - Reduced dust ingress and lower maintenance needs  
  - Silent operation  
  - Lower overall power consumption  
- Ideal for harsh or noise‑sensitive industrial environments.

## 🌐 Networking & Connectivity
- Equipped with **two RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet ports**:
  - One port supports **PoE PSE**, allowing it to power external devices such as IP cameras directly over Ethernet.  
  - The second port provides standard Gigabit networking for connection to switches, routers, or industrial networks.  
- PoE capability simplifies deployment in locations where separate power lines are difficult to install.
