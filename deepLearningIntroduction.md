## Getting Started with Deep Learning

Deep learning is a key technology driving AI and machine learning innovations.
The course introduces basic concepts with simple explanations and examples.
Focus areas:

* Steps to build deep learning models.
* Using Keras and TensorFlow for implementation.
* Hands-on exercises for skill assessment

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with:
* Machine learning concepts and technologies.
* Python programming and Jupyter Notebooks.

## What is Deep Learning?
* Definition: A subfield of machine learning focused on building and using neural network models.
* Structure: Neural networks with more than three layers are typically considered deep learning networks.
* Inspiration: Neural networks mimic the human brain, organized like brain cells, and imitate how humans process data and make decisions.
Growth Factors:
* Algorithms have existed for years, but recent advances in:
  * Large-scale data processing
  * Inference technologies (e.g., GPUs)
These advances have driven real-world adoption.

## Popular Applications:
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) – ideal for unstructured data.
* Speech recognition and synthesis.
* Image recognition.
* Self-driving cars – cutting-edge technology powered by deep learning.
  
Other Domains:
* Customer experience
* Healthcare
* Robotics

## Linear Regression
* Definition: A basic statistical concept used in machine learning and forms a foundation for deep learning.
* Purpose: Explains the relationship between two or more variables.
* Components:
  * Dependent variable: y
  * Independent variable(s): x (or x₁, x₂, …, xₙ for multiple variables)    
* Equation:
    y=a⋅x+b
    * a = slope
    * b = intercept
* Nature: Provides a linear relationship between y and x.
* Reality: Predictions may have errors because real-world relationships are not perfectly linear.
* Use Case: Regression problems to predict continuous variables.
* Multiple Variables:
    * y=a1x1+a2x2+⋯+anxn+by = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \dots + a_n x_n + by=a1​x1​+a2​x2​+⋯+an​xn​+b

## Building a Linear Regression Model
* Goal: Determine slope (a) and intercept (b) using known values of x and y.
* For one variable: Use two equations and substitution to find a and b.
* For multiple variables: Becomes more complex.

## Logistic Regression (Related Technique)

* Used for binary classification (output y = 0 or 1).
* Formula similar to linear regression but includes an activation function f:
* y=f(a⋅x+b)y = f(a \cdot x + b)y=f(a⋅x+b)
* Converts continuous output into a boolean (0 or 1).
* Can also extend to multiple independent variables.
